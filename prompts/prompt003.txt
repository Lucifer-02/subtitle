"OK, you need to have JavaScript enabled in the browser.|You need to have Java enabled in the browser.|Some of you might not have Java installed|or might not have it enabled.|You may have to download it from Sun.|There's some description of how to do that.|But if we go to--|I'm using a Mac, so this is maybe|different from what you're going to see.|But under where is it?|Is it under main?|So I've got enable JavaScript, enable Java ticked.|You also need cookies enabled.|But you can limit it to just cookies that|come from the originating server,|so no third party cookies need to be allowed.|Cookies pose a little bit of a security risk.|What else?|Let's go back to this and see what I've|forgotten to tell you about.|All right, so first two assignments are due next week.|I mentioned that.|The first assignment is about the syllabus.|I would really, really, really not like to get email.|Unless it's absolutely essential that I|get the message and that nobody else get the message.|So if you see a bug or a typo in the book,|in the online materials, the problem set.|I want to know about it.|I want to know about as soon as possible.|I want to fix it.|I'm very grateful, so forth and so on.|But if you don't follow the instructions and that results|in something unexpected happening, that's not a bug.|So if you do find a bug or a typo--|so for example, if it's before the due date on the problem|set, and there's no submit button, that's not a bug.|That's your clock set to the wrong time.|OK?|All right.|To report a bug or a typo, there's a bunch of information|that I need, including your student ID, the page you were|on, what browser you were using, what operating system you have,|it's all detailed in the syllabus.|There's a laundry list of stuff that I|need to do, I need to look at, in order|to be able to debug it, and figure out what's going on.|Typos don't require that.|If you need an accommodation for the exam,|if you're a DSP student, please let me know as soon as possible|so I can make arrangements for proctors.|If through circumstances beyond your control,|you are unable to complete the course|and you are in good standing up to that point,|then you are eligible for an I grade, in which case|you should contact me to arrange for an I grade|and what you're going to need to do to remove the I grade.|And then if you have some issue with the graduate student|instructor, I'm not suggesting that you would,|I don't even know who the GSI is going to be yet,|so it's not like I have qualms about the GSI.|But if something's happening that you|need to discuss with me privately,|and you can't discuss with the GSI,|then that's a reason to send email, or meet with me|before class, or meet with me during the break,|or meet with me after class, or come to office hours|or something like that.|If you have an administrative question that|isn't already answered in the syllabus,|or you have a question about the course material,|the thing to do with that is to post it|to the discussion group.|We're going to use Google Groups for the discussion board.|Now let me talk about that a little bit.|Things are easiest, and it might be|the only possible way of doing it,|if you have a Gmail address.|How many people here do not have a Gmail address--|a relatively small number.|I believe that everybody can just sign up for a Gmail|address at this point.|The email address that you're going|to use for the discussion board is not|necessarily the email address that the registrar has for you.|So you're going to have in essence two email addresses|for this class.|The one that you use to log into the problem|sets, the official one that you have on record|with the University and then the email address|that you use for Google Groups, which is a Gmail address.|To get onto the Google group, what you need to do|is go to the group, request to join.|In the request to join, say what your SID is.|I will then look at your SID, look|at the roster for the class, make sure you are enrolled,|and let you into the discussion board.|So at the moment, this is limited|to people who are enrolled in the class,|not people who are on the waiting list.|I'm not expecting that a lot of people are going to drop,|but I'll deal with that as things fall out.|Maybe what I should do is like include the top 10|people on the waiting list for now or something like that.|So if you're in that situation, come to me after class,|and I'll try and figure out what to do.|All right, the discussion board--|I tried over the summer to limit the number of threads that|didn't work very well at all.|So post a question to the discussion board.|I will try to answer it within 12 hours on weekdays.|In fact, you will find that I usually|answer it within a couple of hours|even if you send it at 3 AM.|I mean I just sort of--|I'm a little compulsive.|So if you have a question about course material|or an administrative question that|isn't answered on the syllabus or in the other stuff that's|online, post it to the discussion board.|The reason for doing it there is that many other people|might have the same question.|Now the discussion board really doesn't|help as a method of posting things publicly|if people don't read it.|So before you post your question to the discussion board,|having already read the syllabus and already read|the instructions to the problem set,|search the discussion board to see|if your question is answered on the discussion board already.|It's kind of irritating to get 17 questions about exactly|the same thing.|And I'm not fun when I'm irritated, so all right.|I don't know of a good reason to call me on the phone|unless you are injured or something,|and need to do-- there's really an emergency.|Otherwise, please don't.|My office phone forwards to my cell phone, which|is by my bedside at night.|And if you think, I'll just call and leave a message at 3:00|in the morning, you're actually going to wake me up.|So don't please.|This is the URL for the discussion group.|It's also mentioned in the syllabus.|Once you have a Gmail address, if you don't already, go|to Groups, search for this, or else navigate directly to that.|I mentioned that in your request to join the group,|you should include your SID.|That is the only thing that ever goes to the group with your SID|on it."
