The following paragraph is the transcript (from srt file) of Statistics 21 UC Berkeley lecture, translate it into Vietnamese, do not remove "|" characters, It is used to separate subtitles: 
"Now the premises can, in fact, be false.|That's a different issue.|That goes to soundness rather than validity.|An argument is sound if it is both valid|and its premises are true.|OK, so a valid argument is sound if the premises are true.|So here's an example of an argument.|If A is true, then B is true.|A is true.|Therefore, B is true.|OK, that's a valid argument.|We can't tell whether it's sound or not, because we don't know--|so these are the premises, if A is true, then B is true.|And A is true.|Those are the premises.|The conclusion is that B is true.|The conclusion is usually flagged|by a keyword like therefore or hence|or we see that or something like that.|OK?|We usually omit the words "is true"|and just assert the statement itself.|So another way of writing this would be, if A, then|B. A, therefore B. So we just leave out the words "is true."|And if something is false, so if, for example, if A is false,|a different way of saying that is not A.|You're asserting that not A is true.|So whenever you see an expression like this, whenever|you see a piece of math in this course,|it's a good idea to try to plug something from the real world|into the mathematical expression in order to make sense of it.|So here's an example.|A might be it is sunny.|B might be I will wear sandals.|And then the conclusion, so I'm saying it is sunny,|therefore I will wear sandals.|In this case, it might even be sound.|All right, so suppose that it isn't sunny.|Does this say anything about whether I will wear sandals|or not?|No, OK.|So if it isn't sunny, then it can still|be true that if it is sunny I will wear sandals,|whether I'm wearing sandals or not on a day that isn't sunny.|That somehow, the only way to falsify that statement|is for it to be sunny and for me not to wear sandals.|If it isn't sunny, then whether I wear sandals or not|doesn't make that hypothesis false, that premise false.|Is that clear to everybody?|OK.|All right, so here is an example of a valid argument|that perhaps isn't sound.|Cheese more than a billion years old is stale.|The moon is made of cheese.|The moon is more than a billion years old.|Therefore, the moon is stale cheese.|[LAUGHTER]|OK?|If the premises were true, the conclusion|would have to be true.|So it's a valid argument.|But I'm pretty well convinced that the moon is not|made of cheese, and therefore this|isn't a sound argument, valid, but not sound.|Here are some valid rules of reasoning.|Actually, are we out of time?|No, we got one more minute.|All right.|So A or not A--|it is always the case that either A is true or A is false.|It's one or the other there.|There's no middle ground, it's true or it's false.|No quantum logic here.|It is never the case that A is both true and false.|OK, you can have one or the other, not both.|If A is true, then the assertion that A or B is true|is also true.|If A and B are both true, then A and B are both true.|This is all stuff that you've probably seen before.|If A is not true, then the assertion|that A and B are both true is not true.|Now A and B is the same as B and A. So not B, therefore|not A and B also follows from this, right?|That's the same rule, just written in different letters.|OK, A or B , not A, therefore B. If A or B must be true,|and A isn't true, then it must be the case that B is true.|Otherwise A or B couldn't be true.|That's called denying the disjunct.|These rules go back to classical times|this is very, very old, old stuff.|The negation of A and B is equivalent to the negation of A|or the negation of B. If the conjunction A and B is--|so A and B is a conjunction.|If that is false, then one or the other or both of A and B|are false.|The negation of a disjunction or the negation of A or B,|if A or B is false, then both A must be false, and B most|be false.|If A then B, A therefore B. That's|called affirming the precedent.|Modus ponendo ponens, affirming by affirming,|all these things have Latin names.|If A then B, not B, therefore not A. If A then B,|and B didn't happen, well, how can this still be true?|Well, A must not have happened.|Now a common fallacy--|we'll get into fallacies next time.|But a common fallacy is if A then B, not A,|therefore not B. OK, that doesn't follow.|All right?|All right.|See you guys on Tuesday.|If you're in the top 10 on the waiting list, stick around|and we'll figure out how to get you into class."
