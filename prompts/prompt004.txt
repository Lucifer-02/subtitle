"That email requesting to join goes to me.|It doesn't go to the discussion board.|Your SID doesn't get posted.|If you think something went wrong,|you want to make a bug report, the bug report|comes to me by email, not through the discussion board.|Because the bug report needs to have|your SID and other personal identifying information.|If you post your SID to the discussion board,|everybody in the class knows your SID.|They might also know your email address.|That means that they can submit homework for you.|Just don't go there.|It's protected by FERFA.|I don't want it going off university-based servers,|so keep it to yourself.|GSI has yet to be determined.|Office hours-- I'm going to have office hours from 1 to 2|PM at the Qualcomm Cyber Cafe.|That's the cafe that just opened in the Citrus Building|over there that has the big Peet's sign out front.|So that's where I'll be having office hours.|Right now it seems like there's a lot of seating there,|and it isn't very crowded.|And it's just a nice place, and there's caffeine available,|which is always good.|Hmm, OK, let me jump ahead to talking about the homework,|because we did most of that.|And then I'll come back and talk about the book a little bit|more.|So typically there's going to be two assignments per week.|After the due date, you will be able to go back and see|the solutions to your problems.|And the way that that works is the same way|that works in the book, so we'll see that momentarily.|How is homework graded?|So as I mentioned before, only the last|of your up to 5 submissions counts.|If you get less than 80% on that last submission,|you don't get any credit at all for the homework.|This is a mastery-based grading.|You need to keep trying until you get at least 80% right.|If you get at least 80% right, then your score|is whatever your score is.|So if you get 80%, you get 0.8 for that homework.|If you get a 100%, you get one point for that homework, OK?|Now the homework rate at the end of the semester|is based on that.|It's sort of the percentage that you got right,|with the 0 substituted for every score less than 80.|All right, let's talk to the rest of this, and then go back|and start talking about the book because that|will be a chance to start presenting some material.|Yes?|STUDENT: Are your office hours like every day?|PHILIP STARK: That's right after class on Thursdays,|but not this week.|It'll start next week, so 1 to 2, Thursdays after class.|There's a midterm-- oh, sorry?|STUDENT: For all the time and stuff,|[INAUDIBLE] groups and whatnot, if we're on the wait list,|should we apply now or [INAUDIBLE]|wait until we get in the class?|PHILIP STARK: I think if your number on the wait list|is 10 or below, come see me right after class,|and I will set you up with access to the homework|and make sure that you can get into the Google group.|If you're on the waiting list, but your number's above 10,|I just really don't think you're going to get in the class.|I mean it could happen, you know,|and monkeys could fly out of my butt, but you know, so--|[LAUGHTER]|Anyway, OK.|There's a midterm in class on Tuesday, the 6th of October.|That's going to be administered by a GSI.|I actually have to be in Washington, DC|for a conference on that day, so I|know I'm not going to be here.|The exams, typically there's discussion of them.|There's practice materials online and so forth,|and we'll talk about that a lot more as things move along.|But most people will not feel time pressure on the midterm.|I mean I really try to make the exams fit comfortably|within the allotted time.|Typically on final exam, people start|leaving between an hour and five to an hour and 15 minutes|into a three hour exam.|Some people stay till the end.|Same thing with midterms, typically in an hour|and a half midterm, people will start|leaving after 45 minutes, 50 minutes, something like that.|So that doesn't mean that you won't feel time pressure,|but most people don't.|OK, so midterm, 6th of October in class, no make up times.|That's it.|Final exam, Tuesday, 15th of December from 5 to 8 PM.|I'm not offering any makeup times|for the final or the midterm.|If you are on a sports team or something that's|going to require you to be at an away|meet for that particular day or what not, come and see me.|But that's basically the only reason that I would make|some kind of accommodation for that, DSP students|not withstanding.|Are we clear on all this stuff?|We'll back up here and talk about the book a little bit|and how to work with this stuff.|Actually, why don't we take?|Do you want to take a minute break?|Or is this, since we're kind of just chatting,|this doesn't require a lot of focus, we'll blow through.|Let's keep going today, all right?|OK, so how do you use the book?|So first of all, it doesn't work if you don't read it.|You really do have to read it.|And I've made effort to put important things in colored|boxes to say them again.|But I don't tend to say things 16 times.|So a lot of books say things and they say them again,|they say them again, they say them again.|Here typically things are said once|and then it's presumed that you know them.|So you got to read it.|Work all the examples and the exercises in the chapter.|If you reload the chapters, many of the exercises and examples|change.|So you can get a virtually unlimited amount of practice|on the material to complement the homework.|If you go to do the homework and you're puzzled by something,|you can go look in the chapter, try a practice example|that's similar to it.|Reload it, get a different version,|reload it, get a different version|until you're pretty comfortable with what's going on,|and then answer it.|There are not problems that are exactly|like every homework assignment.|And this is a source of some consternation, confusion,|irritation, whatever on all parts repeatedly.|But there is a common epistemic error on the part of students|that there is some bestiary of problems.|That there's sort of like some zoo,|and there's a specimen of each possible problem.|And that my job as the professor is|to show you one of each possible problem|so that then when you see that problem again,|you know what to do.|Life isn't like that.|There is no bestiary of problems.|Every problem requires thinking things through from scratch."
