"This course is not about learning formulae and figuring|out which formula to use in a particular situation.|The formulae-- I'm hoping to teach you|all how to get the formulae in the first place.|So where does this stuff come from?|How do think about it?|Because if you're thinking about it straight,|you can derive all the formulae from scratch, right?|And the formulae are just sort of answers to problems|that come up often.|They're not the answer to every possible problem.|So what you need to do is formulate the problem|carefully.|Be really clear on what's given, what's|being asked of you, what's going on,|what's the connection to reality, what's the map here,|how do you turn the words into symbols, so forth and so on.|And if you can do that well, there's|no question of which formula to use.|It'll just drop out.|You'll just find it.|So this course is really not about memorizing things.|It's about thinking things through, reasoning|from first principles.|And that's why the logic is so important,|and that's why we're starting with logic as a topic.|So you will find in the homework problems|that are not superficially the same as any problem|in the textbook.|On a deep level, they're often very similar.|And the issue is to somehow figure out|how to break it into pieces, find pieces that you recognize,|understand what's going on, and figure it out.|It's really about figuring it out, so a lot|of figuring things out.|There are footnotes scattered throughout the chapters.|Some of those footnotes, in essence,|answer questions that are asked in the problem sets.|So the footnotes, there's some things|that have additional technical detail.|Some have anecdotes.|Some have things that I think are funny.|I don't know whether you will, but click the footnotes.|Have a look.|We'll get there in just a second.|Any questions so far?|Yes?|STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]|PHILIP STARK: The only required text for this book|is the online book.|And I think I might have required a book called How|to Lie with Statistics by Huff.|If I didn't require it, you should|go buy it and read it anyway.|It's about this thick.|It's a paperback.|It's probably the best single book|ever written about statistics.|It's good bathroom reading.|[LAUGHTER]|I mean it doesn't take long to go through it.|And it'll change how you read the newspaper forever.|And that's really my goal in this course|is to change how you think about quantitative evidence,|change how you read the newspaper forever.|I'm really trying to get at how you think.|I'm not trying to teach you a bunch of facts.|The book by Freedman, Pisani and Purves is recommended.|If you find my exposition opaque or it just|doesn't work for you for whatever reason,|that's an absolutely fabulous paper book.|It's probably the best paper book out there.|It's a better written, better crafted text|than my own online book.|But you know, I'm doing it my way.|So the book by Freedman, Pisani and Purves--|it's now in its fourth edition.|An older edition would be fine if you|want to read it to supplement things.|You might find it particularly useful|to supplement a number of the chapters|that we're going to do.|Some things to do with descriptive statistics|like the mean, median, and mode, things|to do with scatter plots and correlation coefficient|regression, observational studies versus experiments.|It's description of a box model, how|to draw a parallel between some real world situation|and drawing tickets out of a box.|It's a particularly good supplement|for this course on all those topics.|There are topics where we're going to go a lot further|than that book does.|In particular, in probability, in counting arguments,|in hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals,|there's a variety of things we're|going to do that that book won't be a lot of help|with because it doesn't really address them in the same depth.|Other questions?|Yes?|STUDENT: Do you have a hard copy--|PHILIP STARK: Do I have a hard copy of the book?|I have not made a physical reader of the book.|I can do that and set it up for you guys at Copy Central|if enough people want it.|But let me show you why it's just not|going to mimic the electronic version very well.|One of the problems is that the chapters have applets|built into them to have you do little experiments as you|read through.|And while having a printed version of it|sort of freezes one thing in, but you can't really|do the experiment.|So it may be useful for note taking,|but it's not the same experience, not the same thing.|Other questions?|Yes?|STUDENT: Will the online book be available after we|finish the class--|PHILIP STARK: Oh yeah.|No, it's free.|It's available.|It's out there.|It's open to the world.|There's no charge.|It's just there.|Yeah, but the question was, will the book|remain available after the course?|It will as long as I remain available.|[LAUGHTER]|Any other questions about this?|So let's go to the book.|Oh, it's already open over here.|OK.|I'll let you read the preface and the introduction|on your own.|The introduction has some hints on how|to read through this stuff.|But the first meat that we're going to see|is Chapter Two on Reasoning and Fallacies.|Can those of you in back read that?|Is it big enough?|OK, just navigating this stuff to get started.|So Home will take you back where we just were.|Text Table of Contents has all these chapters listed|and brings up a glossary in the bottom.|There's a lot of links from the chapters into the glossary.|When you click a glossary link, it brings up|an entry in the bottom pane."
