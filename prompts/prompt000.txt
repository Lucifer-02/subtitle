"PHILIP STARK: The only times--|I've been recorded for TV news a couple|of times talking about this or that, the lottery or the census|or something like that.|And the other times I've been videotaped|had been for depositions.|I do expert witness work.|And being on camera it makes me very nervous.|So I'm really feeling on edge doing this.|I'm very uncomfortable with the idea|that this is all going to be out on the web for everybody|to see.|But the reason for webcasting it is actually not|for this class this semester.|It's to have some recorded lectures|to go with the summer version of the class, which|is an online class, so that they'll have something|to look at, a talking head.|I'm not entirely convinced that watching a recorded lecture has|a whole lot of value added.|But we'll find out in a while.|I think the value is probably being here in the room,|being able to ask your own questions.|I'll do my best to pay attention to whether you're|giving signs of understanding or not understanding,|and if it looks like there's a lot of blank looks,|I will try to slow down, rephrase, et cetera.|But you can do me a huge favor by asking|me questions if you are lost, confused, if you think|I'm wrong, whatever it is.|And I will start by telling an anecdote|to support why this is a good idea.|When I was working on my PhD, I took|a class from many brilliant people,|but one especially brilliant man, George Backus|and was taking a course in continuum mechanics.|My PhD is in geophysics.|And there was some point in the lecture|that I was just utterly lost.|And you know, excuse me, excuse me, Professor Backus.|I don't see how you get from this line to that line.|And he stood back, and he looked at it for a moment.|And he said, you're right.|It's wrong.|And he thought I was brilliant ever after that|and I was just lost.|So anyway, you're doing yourself and everybody else in the room|a favor if you ask questions when you find yourself lost.|You might be lost because what I'm telling you is wrong.|That happens.|OK, still waiting for people to drift in before it really|starts going here.|Another general thing about lectures.|I will try to give you guys a three minute break about|halfway through the class.|I don't think anybody's attention span|is an hour and 20 minutes long.|So just a chance to stretch your legs and get a drink of water,|whatever.|If you see 45, 50 minutes go by, and I|haven't remembered to give you a break, feel free to remind me.|Let's see, so if this class is from 11:10 to 12:30,|then I should be shooting to give a break around a quarter|to 12, something like that.|So that's what you can hope for.|There are seats here in the middle,|if you guys want to find a place to be comfortable.|Got another two or three minutes.|I don't yet have a GSI for the class.|When I do, I hope that you will route most of your day|to day communication through the GSI.|Just because it's pretty hard for me|to deal with everybody and deal with the technology|behind the scenes and the message board, et cetera,|all at the same time.|There's still another seat in front,|a couple of here in the middle.|There's even chairs in the back row.|You don't have to sit on the steps.|[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]|OK, I'm going to put my cellphone on vibrate.|I would love it if everybody else would do the same.|I'll get there when we start the lecture, looks|like a minute and a half, no.|OK, there's my department home page|with me looking like you will never see me in lecture.|So the statistics.Berkeley.edu slash tilde Stark,|or if you go to the Statistics home page|you'll be able to find it.|If you go from there to teaching,|then this is our class here, Stat 21.|And there's the course information.|That's the syllabus for the class.|And I'm going to talk you through some of the syllabus.|And then your first problem set, the content of the problem set|is the syllabus.|You get credit for reading the syllabus.|On the other hand, you get punished|if you ask me questions that are answered in the syllabus.|So I'm really doing this to kind of--|just read the syllabus.|Read the instructions for the problem sets.|Pretty much anything, any administrative question|you might possibly have is answered there.|If it isn't answered there, I'm happy to answer it,|and I will then add it to the syllabus|so that I don't have to answer it again next time.|But please, please read the syllabus carefully|before you send me your GSIs or anybody emails|about this stuff.|A few more people drifting in and then we'll get going.|Some space right here in front, right in the middle.|OK, I think it's officially at least 10 past.|So I'll start officially.|So welcome to Stat 21.|This is a bit of an unusual class.|It's intended for business and economics majors primarily.|The textbook that we're using is an online book that I wrote.|I emphasize some topics that are not typically taught|as part of a statistics class.|The reason that I cover these particular topics|is that I found in the process of trying to teach statistics|that people are lacking some skills in logical reasoning,|counting, and other kind of more fundamental things|that are absolutely crucial to making|a good statistical argument or learning of probability|and the statistics.|So the course is actually going to start off|with reasoning and fallacies.|And then go on to do some descriptive statistics.|Then some counting, set theory, propositional logic,|probability, and then more inferential statistics,|hypothesis testing, confidence intervals,|and things like that.|The course is pretty demanding in the amount of time|that it will take you to do all the work.|The homework assignments can take quite a long time.|That said, I'll explain the grading in a little while.|I mean it's possible to do well, and people|do do well very often.|A large fraction of the class ends up making A's.|Unfortunately, a smaller, but still notable|fraction of the class ends up failing.|So things end up heavily bimodal in statistical jargon,|a lot of A's, a lot of non A's.|How many of you are on the waiting list, OK, quite a few.|The waiting list is not in my control at the moment.|I don't expect that more than about 10%|of the people who are enrolled are going to drop."
