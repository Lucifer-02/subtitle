"So if you're beyond number 10 on the waiting list,|it's pretty unlikely that you're going to get into the class.|I can't promise that if your number is less than 10|you will get into the class.|The enrollment limit is 100 and as people drop,|other people will be added.|But I'm going to freeze things sometime next week,|because there are assignments that I need to get going on.|And I can't set up access for people who aren't in the class,|hoping that they'll get into the class, so forth and so on.|My understanding is that the other section of Stat 21|still has quite a bit of room.|So if you need Stat 21, and you can get the other one|into your schedule, I would recommend that you do that.|OK, there's a gentleman in the back of the room|with a video camera.|This course is being webcast.|I don't know exactly what the story is on posting|the videos at the moment.|But be advised that if you are in the room,|you may end up on the camera.|And your voice may end up being recorded,|and that could end up on Berkeley's webcast,|on iTunes University, or on YouTube.|So I will sort of take it as tacit consent,|that if you keep coming to the class,|you were consenting to this.|If it is not OK with you to be on camera, et cetera,|you need to let me know.|And I'm not sure what provisions ETS has|for dealing with that exactly.|But is there anybody who has a problem with that?|Speak now to the camera.|OK, all right, so I'm assuming that we're good,|and I will bear the brunt of the embarrassment|of standing in front of this and having it on the web.|OK, the URL for the course is this--|statistics.Berkeley.edu slash tilde, my last name Stark slash|Teach with a capital T slash S21 with a capital S slash FO9|with a capital F. And I just showed|people who were here earlier how to get there from my home page.|Why don't we start from the Statistics Department home|page just for [INAUDIBLE].|OK, so there's the Stat Department.|If you go to People, somewhere in there is me.|There I am.|There's the home page.|Teaching is over here on the left.|There's our course, Stat 21.|And that is basically the syllabus and links|to everything else that you need,|including the online textbook and so on.|But first, that's the textbook.|That brings up a page that has the assignments|and let's you look at your scores|once you've submitted assignments.|These are sublinks in that page, what's|the schedule for the assignments,|how to troubleshoot things.|Course Info is this page that we're looking at now,|and these are all links to this page.|So I'm going to walk you through a fair amount of this stuff.|But there's a lot of information here.|Please read it.|The URL for the textbook is this, sticky gooey.|You can go back here, the link to it is over here.|There's also a link from my home page there.|Oops, I'm sorry.|That's from the teaching page, there from my home page|as well, all right.|So let's talk about looking at the assignments,|because that's going to be a concern for everybody.|So from here, if we're on the course homepage,|if you click Assignments and Scores,|you get the following page.|Now notice-- it says None.|We are not in the course, None.|We are in a different course.|Our course is Stat 21, Fall 2009, UC-Berkeley.|You got to select that.|If you don't select that, what you will see when you go down|is that all of these assignments were due in the year 2000, OK?|And if you try to log in, it'll say|you're not enrolled, because you're not|enrolled in that course.|If you select our class, and wait a second for the cursor|to come back, then you will see the due dates for our course.|So the first two assignments are due next week.|All right, let me just walk you through this to just get you|started.|So my last name is Stark.|First name is Philip.|You're welcome to call me Philip.|I'm not telling you what my student ID is.|OK, what do you put in here?|Put in your name.|Put in your student ID, the email address that|needs to go in here is the email address|that the registrar had on record as of last week.|Those are the email addresses that I pulled in order|to set up access for people.|So everybody who was enrolled as of, I think, Sunday,|I have your email address.|I have your student ID.|I've set you up to have access to the problem sets,|provided you select the right course.|OK, so now if I go and put my scores|on past assignments, what do you think I'm going to get?|I haven't submitted any assignments,|so don't expect to see anything there until you've|submitted something.|But if you click that, it will then populate with it.|All right, so this is a link to the book.|This is a link to a problem set.|So let me click this.|And this is kind of typical of what problem sets look like.|There's two panels.|In the upper panel are the questions and the places|to put the answers.|In the bottom panel will be tools for answering|those questions later on.|There will be applets that do histograms or calculators|or whatever kind of computational tool|you need to solve the problem set.|All right, so what's the URL for the course website.|We were just talking about that coincidentally.|All right, so it's this--|statistics.Berkeley.edu Of tilde Stark, Teach with a capital T,|S21 with a capital S, FO9 with a capital F. That's URL.|OK, what's the URL for the book?|It's this one.|The S and the G are capitalized in Sticky Gooey.|I just had to make something that|was pronounced sticky gooey.|[LAUGHTER]|OK, there is a discussion group for the course.|It is through Google Groups.|We'll talk about that momentarily.|But just to show you what happens here, we scroll down.|At the bottom, there is a button that says Submit for Grading.|If I press Submit for Grading.|It's going to give me a little confirmation screen.|We'll do that in a second.|OK all right, let's do this first, Save My Answers.|And I'll explain what this is about.|OK, my answers have been saved as a cookie on the computer.|They are not reliable storage.|OK, when I press Save Answers, it's saving it here.|It's not saving it on the server."
