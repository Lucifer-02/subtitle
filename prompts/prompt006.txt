"So you click into the top pane, it|will come up in the bottom pane.|The other links here, this will take you|to the Assignment page.|Again remember that you have to select our class.|Give the page a chance to load.|If you change things before the page is fully loaded,|sometimes the browser gets confused.|So you want to wait for the cursor|to come back to normal, et cetera, before you do that.|There is a pop up calculator that|will do various things relevant to the class, including|combinations, uniform random numbers, and square roots,|pretty much the stuff that you need for the course.|These general tools-- this is a whole page|of things that can be useful.|Mostly this is a holding area for things|that appear in the text in another guise.|So most of these tools will appear in place|where you need them.|But if you ever want to go looking for them,|that's where to go look.|The Review is a list of practice midterms and finals|from other iterations of the course.|When you go looking there for practice materials,|if you see something, if you see a question about something|that we didn't cover, we didn't cover it,|it's not going to be on the exam.|I collect domain names.|It's one of these geeky things, I guess.|I own will that be on the final dot com,|do I need to know this dot com, no partial credit dot|com, and a handful of others.|So it won't be on the final if we didn't cover it.|All right then, so that's Review.|This other stuff is fairly minor.|Let's go back to the Text Table of Contents,|and let's go to Chapter 2.|So we're going to start off with Reasoning and Fallacies.|And just again to show you what happens with this,|the green links are glossary links.|If I click it, it's going to take me down to the bottom pane|to that glossary entry.|There are in text notes like this.|This is what I was encouraging you to click before.|OK, so this is extra information,|in some cases that you don't care about.|In some cases, it's something that|makes good cocktail conversation when you guys are old enough|to drink.|And in some cases, it's a joke or an anecdote or something.|In some cases, it's something useful for solving a homework|problem.|So that's where to go.|Structure of the chapters is all similar.|There's some introduction.|There's some stuff.|I try to put important things in boxes.|There's examples and exercises.|Here's an exercise.|It is not sunny and warm, therefore it is not warm.|So let me reload the page.|Actually, I'm not sure if this is going to reload back.|It is sunny or warm.|It is sunny, therefore it is not warm.|Right, so you get different examples and exercises|when you reload, typically.|Not everything changes, but many things change.|OK, when you answer this, that's a fallacious argument.|If I click this, it will tell me what the right answer is.|In the problem sets after the due date,|you will get that sort of a question|mark next to the answer.|And when you put your answer in, you|will either see a red x or a green check.|So that's the mechanism by which you|see the answers to the homework assignments after the due date.|You go back, and there's that little box there|that you can look at your answers in.|OK, some questions have more detailed solutions worked out,|he said.|But for some reason there's something not happening here.|A bug, go imagine.|How could that be?|OK.|All right, so then there is a quick,|at the end of the chapter, there will be some kind of a summary|and key terms from the chapter.|When you are going back to study for the midterm or the final,|a really good way to do that is look at the things|that I have bothered to give a name to,|to assign a section to.|If I put an entry in the Table of Contents for it,|I probably think it has some importance.|So when you read through, if you see Rules of Reasoning-- what|is he talking about?|If it doesn't ring a bell, you want to go look and refresh|your memory.|At the bottom of those pages where we were just before,|if there's a key term down here, and you don't recognize it,|you want to make sure that you refresh|your memory of what that means.|The other thing is to do the practice exams, the practice|midterm, practice final.|The exams are substantially easier than the homework.|I expect the homework sets to take you several hours.|So an exam is only supposed to take you|several hours in all at most.|I'm trying to gear even the final exam|to take less than three hours.|So going back over the homework is a good thing.|But it's not the ideal thing for studying for the final.|Yes, question?|STUDENT: At what points are the midterms|and practice midterms and finals available?|PHILIP STARK: Right now.|I may add more to them.|But the question was at what point are the practice midterms|and finals available?|And the answer is they're online.|They're right there if we'd click them.|There is not currently an exam online that covers Reasoning|and Fallacies because I just introduced that last semester.|But I think what I'm going to do is|put the final exam from the summer course up online|so that you guys have that to study from as well.|So there will be an example of that sort of stuff as well.|Other questions right now?|We're good?|OK.|Oh my goodness, we're almost out of time.|Let's just quickly start talking about the actual topic, which|is Reasoning and Fallacies.|So this is pointy-headed stuff on some level.|And on some other level, it's incredibly important.|Because people misuse logic all the time in ways that|can be more or less persuasive.|An awful lot of political discourse|involves committing one kind of fallacy or another|and passing it off as valid reasoning.|The fundamental kind of thing we're|going to look at in this chapter is an argument.|So what's an argument?|Well, it's a collection of statements.|Some of the statements are called premises,|and one of the statements is called the conclusion.|And the idea is that you can get from the premises|to the conclusion by logic, so that an argument is valid|if on the assumption that the premises are true,|the conclusion must be true."
