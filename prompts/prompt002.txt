"If I went to a different computer,|my answers would not be there.|Moreover, there are any number of things|that will cause the cookies in your browser to be deleted.|It's very good practice to have your privacy settings|in your browser set up so that the cookies are automatically|deleted whenever you shut your browser down.|Now if you're doing that for this course,|then your intermediate answers are|going to get deleted when you shut your browser down.|If the cookies get too large, the server, in essence,|barks, and says your browser sent a bad request, blah, blah,|blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, OX,|you get some enormous string.|And the only solution to that is to clear|the cookies in the browser, thereby erasing any stored|answers you have.|What's the moral of this story?|Write your answers down, OK?|Write them down on paper.|Keep a physical copy of what you're doing.|So that if the cookies get corrupted,|if they get deleted, if something goes wrong,|you have a way of recovering the work that you've already done.|All right.|So write your answers down.|Don't trust the cookies.|When they work, they work.|And then they don't.|All right, so Submit for Grading, it's ready to submit.|Press OK or Cancel.|I'm going to press OK in a second, but before I do that,|there's going to come a time in the semester|when you, I don't know, travel to the Midwest|and reset the clock to Central Time|from Pacific Daylight Time.|And you're doing the homework at the last minute.|And you're going to come down here,|and there's not going to be a button that|says Submit for Grading.|That's going to be because your clock is|set to a different time zone where problem set is already|past due.|It's not a bug.|You need to reset the clock on your computer.|So if the calendar is wrong on your computer,|the clock is wrong on your computer,|it can be, in reality, before the due date.|But you won't have a Submit button|because your laptop thinks it's too late.|Now if this gives you the idea that you can then set the clock|back on your computer--|[LAUGHTER]|And submit the homework, you can do that.|But the server will know that you submitted it late|and it won't count.|So all right.|OK, so I'm going to press OK now.|And this is going to say, oh, look at that.|Aren't I smart?|I got two out of 50 questions right, 4%.|And I've submitted one of a maximum of five.|Now I'm going to do this again a couple more times just|to show you what happens.|So here it is, I wake this up again.|Oh, my cookie is still there.|And therefore the answers I put in before are still there.|Cookie hasn't been deleted.|I'm going to submit it again.|Maybe I'll get a better grade this time.|OK, oh, I got the same grade.|Let me try again.|You get to submit each problem set up to five times|before the due date.|Only the last submission counts.|If you submit it once and get a great score,|you don't have to submit it again.|That counts.|If you submit it three times and get 95%,|and then on your fourth and fifth times the best you can do|is 80, I'm sorry.|It's the last submission that counts,|not the best submission, just the last one.|Now the first three times you submit it you see your score,|but you don't see what you got wrong.|The fourth and fifth time you submit it,|you see which questions you got wrong.|See these numbers Q3, 4, 5?|Those are all the ones I missed.|How do you match the Q's up to the problem set?|So first of all, there is no way to get back to this screen.|Write them down.|They're gone forever if you navigate away from the page.|You can't use the Back button in the browser to get there.|You're not going be able to get back there.|So this is your one chance after your fourth submission|to see what you missed.|Everybody with me?|All right, so I missed everything but problems one|and two I have a feeling.|But what do these Q numbers mean?|Let's go look back at the problem set again, sorry.|Notice that this is Q1.|This is Q2.|This is Problem 1, this is Problem 2.|Those numbers happen to line up, but some problems|have more than one part.|For example, Problem 21 includes Q23, Q24, Q25, six and seven,|right?|The Q numbers refer to the answer blanks, not|the problem numbers.|So when it says I missed Q3, it's|the answer blank labeled Q3.|It's not Problem 3.|I mean they might happen to be the same,|but they're not necessarily the same.|That's it.|If I go and submit again, that would be my last submission.|You get up to 5, and there it's telling me|that I missed exactly the same ones,|and I don't learn from experience.|It's pretty common.|And now if I go back and say, oh, well,|maybe Professor Stark will be nice and let me have one more|submission, no, OK.|You'll get a similar message if you're late, if you submit it|after the real time.|Is this pretty clear to everybody?|Now the only browser that works reliably,|and reliably, unfortunately, is in inverted commas|still, with the problem set is Firefox.|You have to use Firefox.|If you have Firefox 3.0 point something or other,|it seems to work better than 3.5 point whatever, which came out|about a month and a half ago.|3.5 for some reason has some freezing issues.|The book, almost everything else in the course|will work with most browsers, including Opera, Safari.|Really don't recommend anybody use Internet Explorer,|it's a security risk to you.|But Firefox, Chrome-- they'll work with most of the stuff.|But for the problem sets, what I've debugged with most|thoroughly is Firefox, and that's|what I'm planning to support.|OK, yes?|STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]|PHILIP STARK: 3.0 point something|is better than 3.5 point something.|But if you've already upgraded to 3.5,|it should work, he said, fingers crossed."
